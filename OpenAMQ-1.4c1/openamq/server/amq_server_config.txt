Creating a configuration file
=============================

You can also set the above options in an XML text file, to affect
all future instances of the running server. To create a new XML
configuration file, copy the following block to an editor session,
and then:

 1. Delete all options you want to leave as default.
 2. Delete this comment and update your name and the date.
 3. Save file as new amq_server.cfg or merge with existing copy.
 4. Restart the server.

Setting server options
===========================

port = "5672":
    Specifies the port on which the server should open its connections.
    Default value is 5672.                                             
listen = "*":
    Specifies the network interface on which the server should listen for
    connections. By default this is *, meaning all interfaces. You would 
    choose to set an address when you use OpenAMQ on a server with       
    multiple network interfaces, e.g. routing between two networks.      
    Default value is *.                                                  
queue_timeout = "0":
    Specifies the delay, in seconds, after which auto-deleted queues are
    effectively deleted, following disconnection of their last consumer.
    If zero, queues are deleted immediately. Default value is 0. This   
    option can be changed at runtime.                                   
vhost = "/":
    Specifies the virtual host name, an arbitrary string. OpenAMQ does not
    implement virtual hosts but uses this string to identify servers to   
    prevent client applications from mistakenly connecting to the wrong   
    server. We recommend you set this on production servers and on all    
    failover pairs. Note that the two servers in a failover pair must use 
    an identical vhost identifier. Default value is /.                    
user = "value":
    If you specify a user and group, the server will switch to that user
    and group after opening its port, thus dropping any privileges it   
    previously had. Default value is not defined.                       
group = "value":
    If you specify a user and group, the server will switch to that user
    and group after opening its port, thus dropping any privileges it   
    previously had. Default value is not defined.                       

Setting resources options
===========================

monitor = "0":
    Specifies the interval in seconds at which the server will report its 
    message rates. If zero, no monitoring is shown. The recommended value 
    is 1, if monitoring is desired. Default value is 0. This option can be
    changed at runtime.                                                   
dump_state = "60":
    Specifies the interval at which the server will report its state. This
    shows the number of messages, queues, consumers, etc. used by the     
    server. If zero, no state is logged. Default value is 60. This option 
    can be changed at runtime.                                            
record_stats = "0":
    Specifies whether or not the server records performance statistics in 
    a format suitable for importing into a spreadsheet. If set, the server
    creates a file called 'amq_server_stats_(portnumber).del' which       
    contains performance statistics in a comma-delimited format. For this 
    setting to take effect, the monitor option must also be set. Default  
    value is 0. This option can be changed at runtime.                    

Setting logging options
===========================

log_path = "/var/log/openamq":
    Specifies the directory into which active log files are placed. To get
    the old behaviour, set this option to 'logs'. Default value is        
    /var/log/openamq.                                                     
keep_logs = "1":
    Specifies whether or not the server should keep logs. If zero, the 
    server will not keep logs. If 1, it will keep an alert log, a daily
    log, and a debug log as specified. Default value is 1.             
archive_cmd = "value":
    If specified, this command is run on all archived log files. You can 
    use this option to compress archived log files, or clean up old and  
    unwanted files. When the command is run, the name of the archived log
    file is provided to it as a single argument. Default value is not    
    defined.                                                             
alert_log = "alert.log":
    The name of the alert log file, which records all errors and warnings 
    issued by the server. Note that the server port number is always added
    to the name of the log file. Default value is alert.log.              
daily_log = "daily.log":
    The name of the daily log file, which records all normal activity as
    well as errors. Note that the server port number is always added to 
    the name of the log file. Default value is daily.log.               
debug_log = "debug.log":
    The name of the debug log file, which records all normal activity,   
    errors, and debug trace information. Note that the server port number
    is always added to the name of the log file. Default value is        
    debug.log.                                                           
debug_route = "0":
    Specifies whether exchange routing is logged or not. Set this option
    when you are debugging a message routing design. For production use,
    we recommend you do not set this option. Default value is 0. This   
    option can be changed at runtime.                                   
debug_queue = "0":
    Specifies whether queue dispatching is logged or not. Set this option 
    when you are debugging message processing in the server. For          
    production use, we recommend you do not set this option. Default value
    is 0. This option can be changed at runtime.                          
debug_peering = "0":
    Specifies whether peering activity is logged or not. Set this option  
    if you need to debug exchange federation and failover. For production 
    use, we recommend you do not set this option. Default value is 0. This
    option can be changed at runtime.                                     
debug_console = "0":
    Specifies whether console activity is logged or not. Set this option  
    when you are configuring or debugging the console. For production use,
    we recommend you do not set this option. Default value is 0. This     
    option can be changed at runtime.                                     
trace = "0":
    Specifies the protocol debug level, which can be 0 (no tracing), 1    
    (show information and protocol methods), 2 (show protocol animation), 
    3 (show wire-level data). You should not use any tracing on production
    servers except in low-volume scenarios. Default value is 0. This      
    option can be changed at runtime.                                     
syslog = "0":
    Specifies whether or not to use the syslog protocol for logging. By   
    default log files are written directly to disk. If this option is set 
    to 1, uses the syslog protocol for all log files. Uses a priority     
    depending on the type of log message (LOG_ERROR, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG).
    Uses the LOG_DAEMON facility. Has no effect on Windows. Overrides the 
    keep_logs option. Default value is 0.                                 

Setting tuning options
===========================

coremark_cycles = "250000":
    Defines the duration of the automatic CoreMark performance test, in  
    event cycles. If 0, no test will be done. Setting this too high will 
    cause the server to burn CPU at startup. A good value is between 100k
    and 1M. Default value is 250000.                                     
heartbeat = "2":
    Defines the timeout for connection heartbeating. Default value is 2.
    This option can be changed at runtime.                              
setup_timeout = "5":
    Defines the maximum amount of time connection negotiation may take,  
    before the connection is forcibly closed by the server. Default value
    is 5.                                                                
close_timeout = "5":
    Defines the maximum amount of time the server will wait for a client
    to send a connection.close-ok when closing the connection due to an 
    exception. Default value is 5.                                      
accept_retry_timeout = "60":
    Defines the amount of time the server will wait before retrying an    
    accept call if the call failed due to running out of file descriptors.
    Default value is 60. Minimum value is 1.                              
polling_threads = "4":
    On multithreaded builds, defines the number of OS threads dedicated to
    socket polling. Default value is 4.                                   
working_threads = "4":
    On multithreaded builds, defines the number of OS threads dedicated to
    processing, that is, tasks other than socket polling. Default value is
    4.                                                                    
tcp_nodelay = "1":
    If this value is 1, socket data is written immediately, which is     
    usually good for latency. If this value is 0, data is buffered until 
    there is a full packet, which is usually good for throughput. Default
    value is 1. This option can be changed at runtime.                   
tcp_rcvbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use  
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 0.  
    This option can be changed at runtime.                               
tcp_sndbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use  
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 0.  
    This option can be changed at runtime.                               
frame_max = "32768":
    Defines the maximum frame size the server will accept. Larger frame
    sizes are useful for applications that create very large message   
    headers but will cause congestion on multi-channel connections.    
    Default value is 32768. Minimum value is 2048. Maximum value is    
    2097152.                                                           
direct = "0":
    If set to 1, new connections will by default use Direct Mode.   
    Applications can override this by setting the connection->direct
    property on new connections. Default value is 0.                
private_credit = "1024":
    Defines the credit window for private queues. The credit window    
    regulates the flow of messages internally. A higher value will move
    messages faster off private message queues and into the protocol   
    transport threads. This will increase server memory consumption    
    (before configured queue limits are applied) but can improve       
    performance. For high performance applications we recommend using  
    Direct Mode. Default value is 1024.                                
shared_credit = "1":
    Defines the credit window for shared queues. The credit window        
    regulates the flow of messages internally. The default value of 1 will
    provide the best response to blocked/slow clients working on shared   
    queues. Default value is 1.                                           

Setting failover options
===========================

backup = "":
    Used when running the primary server, specifies the failover backup 
    server for the high-availability pair. Use the internet name of the 
    backup server as 'host' or 'host:port' if it is not running on port 
    5672. Do not specify this option together with the 'primary' option.
    Default value is .                                                  
primary = "":
    Used when running the backup server, specifies the failover primary 
    server for the high-availability pair. Use the internet name of the 
    primary server as 'host' or 'host:port' if it is not running on port
    5672. Do not specify this option together with the 'backup' option. 
    Default value is .                                                  
timeout = "5":
    Specifies the delay in seconds after which the backup peer will become
    the primary peer. This switch over will happen only if and when an    
    application connects to the backup peer after the failover timeout has
    expired. Reducing this value will allow failover to happen faster but 
    will increase the risk of unnecessary failover due to transient       
    network issues. Default value is 5. Minimum value is 1. Maximum value 
    is 60.                                                                

Setting federation options
===========================

attach = "":
    If specified, the server will auto-federate to the specified parent   
    OpenAMQ server. This federates three exchanges: amq.service (a direct 
    exchange) using a service federation; amq.data (a topic exchange)     
    using a fanout federation; and amq.dataex (a headers exchange) using a
    fanout exchange. This gives you an instant enterprise service bus     
    (ESB) based on a spoke-and-hub model. You can fine-tune               
    auto-federation using the --attach-login and --attach-vhost options.  
    Default value is .                                                    
attach_vhost = "/":
    Specifies the auto-federation vhost name, an arbitrary string that    
    will be used when connecting to the parent server. This must match the
    vhost setting of the parent server. Default value is /.               
attach_login = "peering":
    Specifies the user name to be used when logging in. You do not need to
    specify a password, it is taken from the security section. Default    
    value is peering.                                                     
attach_all = "":
    If set, the server will auto-federate all exchanges that match the    
    specified pattern which can include * and ? to mean zero or more, or a
    single arbitrary character. You can use naming conventions to federate
    specific groups of exchanges. Put quotes around wildcards to avoid    
    shell expansion. Default value is .                                   

Setting direct options
===========================

batching = "32768":
    Defines the maximum batch size for Direct Mode opportunistic batching
    on message sends. Setting this higher will improve throughput, and   
    usually with lower latency, but will cause higher memory consumption.
    Setting this to zero will switch off batching. Any value less than   
    2048 is treated as zero. Default value is 32768. Maximum value is    
    2097152.                                                             
heartbeat = "2":
    Defines the timeout for Direct Mode connection heartbeating. Default
    value is 2.                                                         

Setting compatibility options
===========================

no_ack = "0":
    Provides backwards compatibility with earlier versions of OpenAMQ for 
    use with shared queues. From 1.4b4 and 1.3d0 onwards OpenAMQ treats   
    the Basic.Consume no-ack flag as meaningful, whereas prior versions   
    ignored this flag. Applications that do not set this flag when        
    consuming from shared queues must now issue Basic.Ack for each message
    they received. The --no-ack option restores the prior way of working  
    and allows old applications to work unchanged. Default value is 0.    

Setting internal options
===========================

auto_crash = "0":
    If set, the server will crash at irregular intervals, being some     
    random point within the number of seconds specified. This is used    
    specifically to test applications for failover and robustness. Set to
    zero for all real usage. Default value is 0. This option can be      
    changed at runtime.                                                  
auto_block = "0":
    If set, the server will block at irregular intervals, being some     
    random point within the number of seconds specified. This is used    
    specifically to test applications for failover and robustness. Set to
    zero for all real usage. Default value is 0. This option can be      
    changed at runtime.                                                  
kernel_limit = "0":
    Sets an action limit for the SMT kernel: after this many steps it will
    exit. Use this to break the server for failure testing. Set to zero   
    for all real usage. Default value is 0. This option can be changed at 
    runtime.
