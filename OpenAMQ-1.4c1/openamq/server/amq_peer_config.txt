Using command-line options
==========================

You can set these options from the command-line; they affect only
the specific instance of the running server:

    --packio 0                     Pack network data before writing
    --tcp_nodelay 1                TCP/IP NODELAY option
    --tcp_rcvbuf 0                 TCP/IP receive buffer, in bytes
    --tcp_sndbuf 0                 TCP/IP send buffer, in bytes

Creating a configuration file
=============================

You can also set the above options in an XML text file, to affect
all future instances of the running server. To create a new XML
configuration file, copy the following block to an editor session,
and then:

 1. Delete all options you want to leave as default.
 2. Delete this comment and update your name and the date.
 3. Save file as new amq_peer.cfg or merge with existing copy.
 4. Restart the server.

            tcp_nodelay = "1"
            tcp_rcvbuf = "0"
            tcp_sndbuf = "0"
        />
    </config>

Setting tuning options
===========================

packio = "0":
    If set, data is packed into larger buffers before writing. This can  
    improve performance significantly on some systems, especially Windows
    and Linux with 2.4 kernels. If you enable this setting, you should   
    test the performance using a bulk message transfer test. The packio  
    option may cause unexpected behaviour when used with very large      
    messages. Default value is 0.                                        
tcp_nodelay = "1":
    If this value is 1, socket data is written immediately, which is     
    usually good for latency. If this value is 0, data is buffered until 
    there is a full packet, which is usually good for throughput. Default
    value is 1. This option can be changed at runtime.                   
tcp_rcvbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, the connection to the server will
    use the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not
    use this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 
    0. This option can be changed at runtime.                            
tcp_sndbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, the connection to the server will
    use the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not
    use this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 
    0. This option can be changed at runtime.
