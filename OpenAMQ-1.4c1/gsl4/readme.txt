GSL is a code construction tool.  It will generate code in all languages
and for all purposes.  If this sounds too good to be true, you need to
read up about iMatix's code generation technology.  Magic is simply
technology that is twenty years ahead of its time.

GSL forms part of the iMatix "Base" technology toolkit, and is provided
under the GNU General Public License (GPL) for free software developers,
and the iMatix General Terms of Business for commercial developers.

This is the fourth major version of GSL since it's origins in 1996.  For

package.
