Subheader 2.1 : Tables and links.
---------------------------------

Column: Explanation:
Table_item_with_some_spaces: Here is what is all means
    We should be able to span this one over
    more lines than just one.
Another_table_item: More things follow in this table.

 Oh yeah: The links. Note how this line ends in a colon:
 but when we indent it, it is not treated as a table header.

You can mail to
  <me@xxxxx.net>
or
  <myself@another.xxxx.com>
or look at the iMatix site
  <http://www.imatix.com>

  You can use colons if you indent the line. Below two links alone!
  <me@xxxx.net> <http://www.xxx.zz>
