C compile scripts
=================

This directory contains the 'c' script and it's dependencies.  This was 
formerly part of Boom (in Base 1.x), but has been moved here since Base
now depends on libraries in foreign.

Please see the 'boom.html' file in the Boom source package for more
information.
