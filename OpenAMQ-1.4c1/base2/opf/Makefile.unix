#   Make programs use the .SUFFIXES psuedo rule for this

.SUFFIXES:
.SUFFIXES: $(EXE) $(LIB) $(OBJ) .c .d .i .l

#   Objects depend on source files with the same name; and are compiled
#   with the iMatix c script without any arguments.
#
.c$(OBJ):
	$(CC) $<
#   And .c files _do_not_ depend on .l files (.l files are Libero files,
#   not lex input files as the default rules think).
#
#   The semicolon forces make to accept the rule as an override.
#
.l.c: ;

#
#   Default rule -- all depends on everything.
#   We do this so that we can define the rule at the end.

all: everything
