Creating a configuration file
=============================

You can also set the above options in an XML text file, to affect
all future instances of the running server. To create a new XML
configuration file, copy the following block to an editor session,
and then:

 1. Delete all options you want to leave as default.
 2. Delete this comment and update your name and the date.
 3. Save file as new demo_srv.cfg or merge with existing copy.
 4. Restart the server.

Setting server options
===========================

port = "7654":
    Specifies the port on which the server should open its connections.
    Default value is 7654.                                             
listen = "*":
    Specifies the network interface on which the server should listen for
    connections. By default this is *, meaning all interfaces. You would 
    choose to set an address when you use OpenAMQ on a server with       
    multiple network interfaces, e.g. routing between two networks.      
    Default value is *.                                                  
user = "value":
    If you specify a user and group, the server will switch to that user
    and group after opening its port, thus dropping any privileges it   
    previously had. Default value is not defined.                       
group = "value":
    If you specify a user and group, the server will switch to that user
    and group after opening its port, thus dropping any privileges it   
    previously had. Default value is not defined.                       

Setting resources options
===========================

monitor = "1":
    Specifies the interval in seconds at which the server will report its
    message rates. If zero, no monitoring is shown. The recommended value
    is 1, if monitoring is desired. Default value is 1.                  
record_stats = "0":
    Specifies whether or not the server records performance statistics in 
    a format suitable for importing into a spreadsheet. If set, the server
    creates a file called 'amq_server_stats_(portnumber).del' which       
    contains performance statistics in a comma-delimited format. For this 
    setting to take effect, the monitor option must also be set. Default  
    value is 0. This option can be changed at runtime.                    

Setting tuning options
===========================

heartbeat = "2":
    Defines the timeout for connection heartbeating. Default value is 2.
setup_timeout = "5":
    Defines the maximum amount of time connection negotiation may take,  
    before the connection is forcibly closed by the server. Default value
    is 5.                                                                
close_timeout = "5":
    Defines the maximum amount of time the server will wait for a client
    to send a connection.close-ok when closing the connection due to an 
    exception. Default value is 5.                                      
accept_retry_timeout = "60":
    Defines the amount of time the server will wait before retrying an    
    accept call if the call failed due to running out of file descriptors.
    Default value is 60. Minimum value is 1.                              
tcp_nodelay = "1":
    If this value is 1, socket data is written immediately, which is     
    usually good for latency. If this value is 0, data is buffered until 
    there is a full packet, which is usually good for throughput. Default
    value is 1.                                                          
tcp_rcvbuf = "value":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use  
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is not 
    defined.                                                             
tcp_sndbuf = "value":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use  
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is not 
    defined.                                                             
frame_max = "32768":
    Defines the maximum frame size the server will accept. Larger frame
    sizes are useful for applications that create very large message   
    headers but will cause congestion on multi-channel connections.    
    Default value is 32768. Minimum value is 2048. Maximum value is    
    2097152.                                                           
direct = "0":
    If set to 1, new connections will by default use Direct Mode.   
    Applications can override this by setting the connection->direct
    property on new connections. Default value is 0.                

Setting logging options
===========================

log_path = "/var/log/demo":
    Specifies the directory into which active log files are placed. To get
    the old behaviour, set this option to 'logs'. Default value is        
    /var/log/demo.                                                        
keep_logs = "1":
    Specifies whether or not the server should keep logs. If zero, the 
    server will not keep logs. If 1, it will keep an alert log, a daily
    log, and a debug log as specified. Default value is 1.             
archive_cmd = "value":
    If specified, this command is run on all archived log files. You can 
    use this option to compress archived log files, or clean up old and  
    unwanted files. When the command is run, the name of the archived log
    file is provided as an argument to it. Default value is not defined. 
alert_log = "alert.log":
    The name of the alert log file, which records all alerts issued by the
    server. Note that the server port number is always added to the name  
    of the log file. Default value is alert.log.                          
daily_log = "daily.log":
    The name of the daily log file, which records all normal activity as
    well as errors. Note that the server port number is always added to 
    the name of the log file. Default value is daily.log.               
debug_log = "debug.log":
    The name of the debug log file, which records all normal activity,   
    errors, and debug trace information. Note that the server port number
    is always added to the name of the log file. Default value is        
    debug.log.                                                           
trace = "0":
    Specifies the protocol debug level, which can be 0 (no tracing), 1    
    (show information and protocol methods), 2 (show protocol animation), 
    3 (show wire-level data). You should not use any tracing on production
    servers except in low-volume scenarios. Default value is 0. This      
    option can be changed at runtime.                                     
syslog = "0":
    Specifies whether or not to use the syslog protocol for logging. By   
    default log files are written directly to disk. If this option is set 
    to 1, uses the syslog protocol for all log files. Uses a priority     
    depending on the type of log message (LOG_ERROR, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG).
    Uses the LOG_DAEMON facility. Has no effect on Windows. Overrides the 
    keep_logs option. Default value is 0.                                 

Setting direct options
===========================

batching = "32768":
    Defines the maximum batch size for Direct Mode opportunistic batching
    on message sends. Setting this higher will improve throughput, and   
    usually with lower latency, but will cause higher memory consumption.
    Setting this to zero will switch off batching. Any value less than   
    2048 is treated as zero. Default value is 32768. Maximum value is    
    2097152.
