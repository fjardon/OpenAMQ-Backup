    Creates a content buffer for use by the script.  Content buffers
    are automatically destroyed when the script ends. The body of the

    <attr name = "size" short = "size of content buffer">

    takes the size of the content where supplied, otherwise defaults to
    1024 bytes.
    </attr>
    <attr name = "fill" default = "random" short = "fill mode">
    Specifies the fill mode.  If the basic_content entity has a

    Specifies the name of a command to run, and get content from.  The
    command's standard output is used as the content body.  The size
    attribute is ignored, and the content body is always the size of
    the command's stdout.  The current content body, if any, is sent
    to the command's stdin.

    <attr name = "headers" default = "1" short = "parse headers?">
    Used only in combination with exec.  If zero, the output of the
    executed program is not reparsed. If one, the output is reparsed
    to collect message properties and headers as follows: each line
    specifies a header field name, followed by ":", followed by a
    space and a value.  Field names starting with "x-table-" are
    stored as-is (minus the x-table- prefix) in a field table with
    that name.  Other fields must match known content properties.
    Hyphens are allowed in field names.  The headers are ended with
    a blank line. Parsed headers create a CGI-like interface for
    calling programs.
    </attr>
    <attr name = "read" short = "file to read content from">
    Specifies the name of a file to read the content body from.  The
    size attribute is ignored, and the content body is always the size
    of the file. Do not define 'read' if 'exec' is defined.  Note: the
    name of the file can be specified using variables, allowing a PAL
    script to "serve up" arbitrary files.
