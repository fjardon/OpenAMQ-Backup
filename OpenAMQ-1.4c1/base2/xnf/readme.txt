XNF - The XML Normal Form Language

XNF is a toolkit for generating validating parsers and code generators
from a normalized XML grammar.  It's simpler and more useful than it
sounds.  If you use GSL to develop serious code generators, you will
find XNF a good way of building them.

XNF is defined using XNF but to ease boot-strapping the XNF validating
parser is not generated from xnf.xnf but included in the command-line
tool xnfgen.
