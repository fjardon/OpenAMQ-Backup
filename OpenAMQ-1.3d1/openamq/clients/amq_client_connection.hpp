    amq_client_connection.hpp - amq_client_connection component wrapper in C++

A amq_client_connection object establishes and manages a single
connection to a amq server. The connection can hold
many sessions - each is a amq_client_session object. To use this
API, first create a connection to the server, then create one or
more sessions and do work on the sessions. Each session represents
a serial stream of work. In simple applications, a single session
is usually sufficient. In multithreaded applications, each thread
will want its own session.
    Generated from amq_client_connection.icl by icl_gen using GSL/4.
