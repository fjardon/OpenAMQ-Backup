    amq_connection.hpp - amq_connection component wrapper in C++

This class acts as a management layer for the amq_server_connection
class.  Ideally, that would be an async class but for now, it implies
too large changes to the architecture.  At some future stage we will
merge these two classes into one.
    Generated from amq_connection.icl by smt_object_gen using GSL/4.
