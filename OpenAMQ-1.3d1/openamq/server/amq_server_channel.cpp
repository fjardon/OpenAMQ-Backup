    amq_server_channel.cpp - amq_server_channel component wrapper implementation in C++

This class implements the AMQ server channel class.  The channel holds
a set of consumers managed both as a list and as a lookup table.  The
maximum number of consumers per channel is set at compile time.

Channel flow control: each channel gets a credit window when it gets a
consumer.  This window defines the maximum size of its flow queue, the
number of contents it has received from a queue but not yet handed to
SMT.  When the channel receives a content from a queue, it spends a
credit.  When it passes a content to SMT it earns a credit.  Queues
check the credit to decide whether or not to use the channel's consumers.
    Generated from amq_server_channel.icl by smt_object_gen using GSL/4.
