      <p>Gurudoc works by recognising layout, and converting this to GDL. We've tried to keep a balance between features and complexity, to give you something useful without becoming too formal. Basically, gurudoc relies on layout rules that also help to make the text readable in any case. For example, blank lines and indentation are significant in most places. One consequence of this is that the plain text file is very readable even before it is converted to any target. </p>
<p>Gurudoc reads an input text file (with any name and extension except '.gdl') and creates an output file with the same name and the extension '.gdl'. It then processes this file as it would any normal input file. The '.gdl' file remains afterwards, so you can use it as the basis for further refinement if wanted. </p>
