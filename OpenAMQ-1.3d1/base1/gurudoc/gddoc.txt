Introduction
************

Gurudoc works by recognising layout, and converting this to GDL. We've
tried to keep a balance between features and complexity, to give you
something useful without becoming too formal. Basically, gurudoc relies
on layout rules that also help to make the text readable in any case.
For example, blank lines and indentation are significant in most places.
One consequence of this is that the plain text file is very readable
even before it is converted to any target.

Gurudoc reads an input text file (with any name and extension except
'.gdl') and creates an output file with the same name and the extension
'.gdl'. It then processes this file as it would any normal input file.
The '.gdl' file remains afterwards, so you can use it as the basis for
further refinement if wanted. 

Gurudoc 
*******

To use Gurudoc, use this command in a DOS box to build the GDL document
from the plain text file:

    mkgdl gddoc

Then use the 'html_simple' (default) skin to get some output files with
these commands:

    gsl -gdl:gddoc gurudoc
    start gddoc.htm

and you can also use the framed skin :

    gsl -tpl:html_frame -gdl:gddoc gurudoc
    start gddoc.htm

GDL is define in the 'gdl.xnf' file.

Then, you can use 'skins' and 'templates' with Gurudoc processor to get
some final outputs.

Standard Gurudoc Definitions
============================

Gurudoc always check if the file start with 'gdl'. This block of
informations end with a line starting with 'end gdl'. You can add
informations to tune the results of Gurudoc.

Chapter and Section Headers
===========================

Gurudoc handles four levels of headers. In the text these look like
this:

    Chapter Header
    **************

    Section Header
    ==============

    Subsection Header
    -----------------

    Subsubsection Header
    ....................

The line following the header text must start with 3 or more asterisks
'*', equals '=', hyphens '-' or dots '.'. There is no way to specify H5
or other headers. I recommend that you start the document with a chapter
header.

The header text line must come after a blank line, or at the start of
the document.

You can also request a horizontal rule by putting four or more
underscore '_', plus '+', hash '#', or tilde '~' characters on a line by
themselves:

    ++++

++++

Paragraphs
==========

A paragraph is anything following a blank line that does not look like
something else. Basically, any plain text following a blank line is
given a <paragraph> tag. Note however the exceptions that follow...

Preformatted Text
=================

If a line is indented by 4 or more spaces, or a tab, Gurudoc treats the
line as 'preformatted' text and inserts a <example> tag. You can mix
blank lines with preformatted text.

Bulleted and Numbered Lists
===========================

Bulleted Lists
--------------

A paragraph starting with a hyphen '-', a plus '+' or a asterisk '*'
followed by a space is considered to be a bulleted list item.

Numbered Lists
--------------

A paragraph starting with a digit [0-9] followed by a dash '-', a dot
'.' or a right parenthesis ')' and followed by a space is considered to
be a numbered list item.

Lists usage
-----------

You can put blank lines between list items, but it's not necessary.
Cosmetically, when list items are short, blank lines are disturbing. But
when list items are several lines, blank lines make the text more
readable. Either way, Gurudoc is happy.

For example:

    - you can do unnumbered lists
    + as many
    * as you like
    1- You can also do numbered lists
    2. With numbers at the beginning of the line
    3) As many as you like.
       We should be able to span this one over
       more lines than just one.

- you can do unnumbered lists
+ as many
* as you like
1- You can also do numbered lists
2. With numbers at the beginning of the line
3) As many as you like.
   We should be able to span this one over
   more lines than just one.

Definition Lists
================

A definition list is a line ending with a colon ':' and followed by some
lines indented by one or more spaces.

For example:

    Indention of text:
        Explanation one.
    Second indention:
        Explanation two.
        We should be able to span this one over
        more lines than just one.

Indention of text:
    Explanation one.
Second indention:
    Explanation two.
    We should be able to span this one over
    more lines than just one.

You can put blank lines between definition items, but again, it's a
matter of cosmetics. There should be a blank line before the first
definition item, however.

Quoted Text
===========

Quoted text is marked by indentation and a leading ", as follows:

    "Life is a stage and we are all but actors in a play"
    -- William Shakespear
    
Tables
======

Gurudoc tries to solve the most common case; a rectangular table
consisting of a N columns and M rows.

A table can start with a header, which is a line like this:

    Some column:  Followed by some explanation:

Some column:  Followed by some explanation:

Here, the colons (':') are important. Gurudoc also wants one or more
spaces after the first colon. The table header is optional; you can
start immediately with table items. Either way, Gurudoc needs a blank
line before the table. A table item looks like this:

    Column: Explanation:
    Table_item_with_some_spaces: Here is what is all means
        We should be able to span this one over
        more lines than just one.
    Another_table_item: More things follow in this table.

Column: Explanation
Table_item_with_some_spaces: Here is what is all means
    We should be able to span this one over
    more lines than just one.
Another_table_item: More things follow in this table.

A bigger one:

    Col 1: Col 2: Col 3: Col 4:
    a11: a12: a13: a14
    a21: a22: a23: a24
    a31: a32: a33: a34
    a41: a42: a43: a44

Col 1: Col 2: Col 3: Col 4:
a11: a12: a13: a14
a21: a22: a23: a24
a31: a32: a33: a34
a41: a42: a43: a44

The first column must be a single word - if you want several words, use
underlines. Gurudoc replaces these by spaces. The explanation can come
on several lines, which MUST be indented by one or more spaces.

Figures and Images
==================

To insert a figure, use one of these conventions:

    [Figure filename: caption]
    [Figure "filename": caption]

For example:

    [Figure mainlogo.jpg: The iMatix logo]
    [Figure "mainlogo.jpg": The iMatix logo]

Gurudoc inserts a figure caption, numbering the figures in a document
from 1 upwards. The caption is followed by an <image> tag to display the
file. You can use a URI (a path) as the filename, or an URL (with a host
name specifier); you must put an URL in quotes. My preference is to put
image files locally with the GDL files, and use a simple filename
without a path. This is just easier to manage and lets you put the GDL
files plus images in any directory. If Gurudoc can find the image you
specify, and it's a .GIF or .JPG file, it will insert the WIDTH= and
HEIGHT= tags automatically.

To insert a plain image, omit the 'Figure' keyword. For example:

    [Figure mainlogo.jpg: The iMatix logo]
    [mainlogo.jpg: The iMatix logo]
    [Figure mainlogo.jpg]
    [mainlogo.jpg]

Hyperlinks
==========

If you use <name@address>, this is converted into a mailto: URL
hyperlink. If you use <http://address/document> -- or any other URL --
this is converted into a hyperlink as well. You can follow the URL by
':description' if you like, e.g.
<http://www.imatix.com:iMatix_Corporation's_Site>.

Gurudoc does not presently allow links within the document or to other
documents.

Multi-file Documents
====================

To include text from another file, use this convention:

    [See filename]

This takes the text from the specified filename and inserts it in place of
the line containing the [See] instruction.


Special Characters
==================

Since you're not typing XML, Gurudoc replaces <, > and & by XML
metacharacters. < and > are used to indicate hyperlinks.


Limitations
===========

Lists and Examples
------------------

You can add example only at the end of a item.

For example:

    Here is a list of commands:
    1. directory content

        ls [Enter]
    
    2. get current directory

        cd [Enter]

Here is a list of commands:
1. directory content

    ls [Enter]
    
2. get current directory

    cd [Enter]

But you reset the counter of the list.

Moreover, if you add a new indented paragraph in it like this:

    Here is a list of commands:
    1. directory content

        ls [Enter]
        
       and for more detail
       
        ls -l [Enter]    

Here is a list of commands:
1. directory content

    ls [Enter]
    
   and for more detail
   
    ls -l [Enter]    

You can see that we lose the paragraph "and for more detail".
