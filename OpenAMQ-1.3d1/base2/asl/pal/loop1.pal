    This script demonstrates how to do a simple loop using a variable that
    we increment and check by hand.  It is not as elegant as the loop2.pal
    example.
    <set name = "index" value = "0" />
    <repeat>
        <if name = "index" value = "10">
            <break/>
        </if>
        <else>
            <echo>I can count up to $index</echo>
        </else>
        <inc name = "index" />
    </repeat>
</pal>
