    ipr_regexp.cpp - ipr_regexp component wrapper implementation in C++

    Provides an interface to the PCRE library.  This is a snippet
    from the PCRE documentation:

    There are two different sets of meta-characters: those  that
    are  recognized anywhere in the pattern except within square
    brackets, and those that are recognized in square  brackets.
    Outside square brackets, the meta-characters are as follows:

           general escape character with several uses
    ^      assert start of subject (or line, in multiline mode)
    $      assert end of subject (or line, in multiline mode)
    .      match any character except newline (by default)
    [      start character class definition
    |      start of alternative branch
    (      start subpattern
    )      end subpattern
    ?      extends the meaning of (
           also 0 or 1 quantifier
           also quantifier minimizer
    *      0 or more quantifier
    +      1 or more quantifier
    {      start min/max quantifier

    Part of a pattern that is in square brackets is called a
    "character class".  In a character class the only meta-
    characters are:

           general escape character
    ^      negate the class, but only if the first character
    -      indicates character range
    ]      terminates the character class
    Generated from ipr_regexp.icl by icl_gen using GSL/4.
