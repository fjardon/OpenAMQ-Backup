    ipr_index.cpp - ipr_index component wrapper implementation in C++

This class provides a mechanism for indexing objects.  An index is a number
from 0 to IPR_INDEX_MAX - 1. The class keeps indexes low by hashing across
a variable part of the index rather than across its full size.  Does not
support the retrieval of objects by their reference, only by index.
    Generated from ipr_index.icl by icl_gen using GSL/4.
