    icl_system.cpp - icl_system component wrapper implementation in C++

    Implements the metacache manager.  Provides two functions for
    application developers: icl_system_purge(), which does garbage
    collection, and icl_system_terminate(), which does final destruction
    of all active and cached objects. Provides one function for iCL
    developers: icl_system_register(), which registers a class for
    purging and destroying.

    Also responsible for system-wide initialisation, comprising
    icl_global_pool and icl_global_mutex.  Note that to avoid circular
    dependencies, these two are declared in icl_apr.
    Generated from icl_system.icl by icl_gen using GSL/4.
